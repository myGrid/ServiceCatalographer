# This script loads up a list of cleaned up synoyms (in the Solr/Lucene synonyms format) and add underscored words.
# It then outputs the final list of synonyms that should be used, to the console.
#
# You need to provide a path (relative to the directory you call this script in) to a file that contains the cleaned up synonym data, as a command line parameter. 
#
# 
# Main usage: 
#
#  ruby script/service_catalographer/process_cleaned_pseudo_synonyms_for_solr.rb "cleaned_pseudo_synoyms.txt"
