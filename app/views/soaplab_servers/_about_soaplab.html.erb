		<b>About Soaplab</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Soaplab services are command line applications, wrapped as SOAP services, and served from a Soaplab server.
		All Soaplab services have the same generic set of SOAP operations (depending on the Soaplab version)
		as they all share a standardised interface. 	
	</p>
	<p>
		Certain tools, like the <%= link_to('Taverna workflow workbench', "http://taverna.org.uk/", :popup => true) %>, 
		provide automatic support for the Soaplab way of executing these services.
		In some cases you will need to use the <b>Soaplab Server Base URL</b> rather than the WSDL location in these tools.
		<br/> 
		More information on Soaplab clients is available <%= link_to('here', "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/soaplab/guide", :popup => true) %>.
	</p>
