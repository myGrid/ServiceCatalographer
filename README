== ServiceCatalographer

The ServiceCatalographer is a Web application that provides a registry of Web services.
Its source code based on that of BioCatalogue - a registry of life sciences Web services
(BioCatalogue, http://www.biocatalogue.org). BioCatalogue was a BBSRC-funded project
(grant numbers: BB/F01046X/1, BB/F010540/1) started in 2008 as a joint venture between
the University of Manchester (led by Professor Carole Goble CBE) and the EMBL-EBI
(led by Rodrigo Lopez). ServiceCatalographer is domain-independent and can be used for
registering SOAP and REST Web services from any domain (and not just from life sciences).

The goals of the ServiceCatalographer are:

- Provide a single registration point for Web service providers and a single search
site for scientists and developers.
- Provide a curated catalogue of Web services.
- Providers, expert curators and users can provide oversight, monitor the catalogue
and provide high quality annotations for services.
- Provide a place where the community can find, contact and meet the experts and
maintainers of these services.
