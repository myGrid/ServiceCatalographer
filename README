== ServiceCatalographer

The ServiceCatalographer is a Web application that provides a registry of Web services. Its
source code based on that of BioCatalogue - a registry of biological services
(BioCatalogue, http://www.biocatalogue.org). The BioCatalogue was a BBSRC-funded project and
has been running since 1st June 2008. The project was a joint venture between the University
of Manchester (led by Carole Goble) and the EMBL-EBI (led by Rodrigo Lopez).
ServiceCatalographer is, however, domain-independent and can be used for registering SOAP
and REST services from any domain.

The goals of the ServiceCatalographer are:

- Provide a single registration point for Web service providers and a single search
site for scientists and developers.
- Provide a curated catalogue of Web services.
- Providers, expert curators and users can provide oversight, monitor the catalogue
and provide high quality annotations for services.
- Provide a place where the community can find, contact and meet the experts and
maintainers of these services.
